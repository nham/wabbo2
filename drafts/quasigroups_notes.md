I.
============================
forall a. b. 
 - exists unique x, xa = b
 - exists unique y, ay = b



II.
=============================

left & right multiplication are bijections



(I => II)

(1) means R_a is surjective. also could not have xa = ya since its unique. so injective

(2) means L_a is surjective. also could not have ax = ay since y is unique. so injective.



(II => I)
 - it means R_a is surjective, so for all b theres an x, x R_a = b. also R_a is injective, so x must be unique
 - ditto L_a.






Ib) for all a. b. c.
 - exists x, xa = b
 - exists y, ay = b
 - ab = ac => b = c
 - ac = bc => a = b


unique solvability implies cancellation: if ab = ac, then b=c since it must be unique. ditto for the other.

conversely,


(could also show that Ib <=> II, since thats pretty much an exact translation of R_x and L_x being bijections)'

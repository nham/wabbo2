I'm interested in "AI", only I'm reasonably sure that we're still in the early pre-history of AI. The only way to work on a problem whose solution you suspect is somewhere between several decades and multiple centuries away is to try to bite off small sub-problems. To that end I'm working on a small sub-problem of the AI problem, the *mind problem*. The challenge is to understand minds in sufficient detail to have a basis for making a detailed outline of the AI problem. This small sub-problem still seems quite tough.

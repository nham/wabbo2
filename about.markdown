I'm Nick and I hope to use this website to facilitate my descent into crackpottery. I'm working on the AI problem, which really needs a better name because much of the work that goes under the heading of "AI" seems to be completely unrelated to this problem.

Here are some websites that I participate on:

 - [github](http://www.github.com/nham)
 - [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18824764-nick-hamann)
 - [google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/107239411748947572422)

What follows is absolute rubbish.

The AI problem might be defined as *how do we build things that think?* (this is somewhat different from conventional formulations, which emphasize building things that are "intelligent". TODO: write up something on this). We immediately have a difficulty here because we don't know what "thought" is (I would like to be wrong about this, please let me know if I am). This is not so out of the ordinary because many research problems have a similar structure: most of the difficulty lies in finding the right question to ask.

I'm currently looking to simulate embodied entities in a physics engine. That is a very basic starting point, and clearly not enough because people have been looking at "embodied" approaches to AI since at least the 1980s (c.f. Rodney Brooks). In other words, chanting "embodiment!" does not suffice to make progress on the problem. I don't yet have an answer for what comes next, other than looking at and trying to understand toy models.

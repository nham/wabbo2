I'm Nick and I hope to use this website to facilitate my descent into crackpottery. I'm working on the AI problem, which really needs a better name because much of the work that goes under the heading of "AI" seems to be completely unrelated to this problem.

Here are some websites that I participate on:

 - [github](http://www.github.com/nham)
 - [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18824764-nick-hamann)
 - [google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/107239411748947572422)

What follows is absolute rubbish.

The AI problem might be defined as *how do we build things that think?* (this is somewhat different from conventional formulations, which emphasize building things that are "intelligent". TODO: write up something on this). We immediately have a difficulty here because we don't know what "thought" is (I would like to be wrong about this, please let me know if you have reason to believe I'm wrong). This is not so out of the ordinary because many research problems have a similar structure: most of the difficulty lies in finding the right question to ask. Once you ask the right question, the answer soon follows. (This task can be difficult because sometimes we don't possess all the words needed to ask the question).
